Impress for Maya
=======================================

Impress is a Maya Python Module that helps make custom functions feel like native Maya commands.

Quickly register new functions as Maya runtime commands and provide option box windows with robust settings. This allows artists to easily access custom functions and incorporate them into their existing workflows.

*This documentation is still being developed.*
